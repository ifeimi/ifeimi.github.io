### iCloud Calendar subscription  
\
I use Apple iCloud Calendar both in work and life, and am maintaining several useful public calendars that might be of interest:  
\

Subscriptions (by simply clicking the calendar names above) are highly welcome. Calendars are usually updated on every Friday afternoon (Central European Time, UTC+1:00).  

### AI tools for subtitling
I'm maintaing an AI-subtitiling tool [WhisperX48](https://github.com/ifeimi/WhisperX48). This project started as a fork from [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper). Modifications were made to incorporate the usage of more accurate Whisper-based models ([WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) for example) and to adapt for other personal demands.

For my own experiences, different translation tools can be consulted: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator), [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/), and a very helpful web dictionary of my favorite - [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/).  

### My personal workflow for video editting
I am kind of experienced in video editting. I started when I was in college in 2017, using [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) because my university provided free license for students.  

However, after graduation, Adobe softwares were no longer available for free. Then I switched to open-sourced [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) in 2021, which I was not quite accustomed to actually. Therefore after I saw a recommendation of [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) from [Mediastorm](https://space.bilibili.com/946974), I immediately started with it. The free version of DaVinci Resolve already offers more than enough functions for me. So I believe I will continue using it for a long time.  

I edit subtitiles with [Aegisub](https://aegisite.vercel.app/), and export videos with hard-coded subtitles using [ArcTime Pro](https://arctime.org/).  

I use (at least from this year) open-sourced fonts [Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto) for my subtitiles.
