Some useful links, documents, and files that might be interesting to share.  

### iCloud Calendar subscription

I use Apple iCloud Calendar both in work and life, and am maintaining several useful public calendars that might be of interest:  

[AKB48](webcal://p103-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/MjA1MjQ3NjAwNDAyMDUyNJHuBm4JvFsW9O5xhZKJaN-GNTNhgzMJxGeVWJ9p-4g1sgAOE2zlE5BUeUfoewECPQjZNGy4ViS-zfdT3BkUyao): Theartre performances and concerts of AKB48.  
[HKT48](webcal://p103-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/MjA1MjQ3NjAwNDAyMDUyNJHuBm4JvFsW9O5xhZKJaN-GGyoCNUTEWTsrAXR1jBUNtvVC4FxIv_9ioZsAlKUVeZ3R72HgRaM9Jv9ZVooX0jc): Theartre performances and concerts of HKT48.  
[GC Frauen](webcal://p103-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/MjA1MjQ3NjAwNDAyMDUyNJHuBm4JvFsW9O5xhZKJaN-87aFlmgc0vDO604UvDuyAy3c-zI8QCUuSGAeCUhDy4xcZf_s_juN2Q9Qdqd_aHLc): Fixtures of [Grasshopper Zürich women's football team](https://gcfrauenfussball.ch/), and of Chinese women's football team.  

Subscriptions (by simply clicking the calendar names above) are highly welcome. Calendars are usually updated on every Friday afternoon (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2:00).  


### AKB lyrics

I will continously upload *timestamped* AKB48 lyrics after I made such videos. They are shared on my Google Drive, [click to open](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oXF-MW6J_jkjdkQ2gXdS2mIRIUMsD14q?usp=share_link). The idea is to save you the labour of timestamping and maybe contribute some Chinese translations. Please take notice of the following notes:  

* I share .ass files where my personal format has been integrated. Feel free to use them if you like, otherwise also feel free to change to your own style. 

* My timestamps are completely free for use. There's no need to acknowledge me in any form if you use only my timestamps in your work. A feature of my timestamping (it's a recommendation as well) is that lyrics are set to *offset audio by -0.5 s*, thus they are easy to follow when you sing along. Use the time-shifting tool provided in your subtitle editting software to *shift all lyrics at the same time*, then there's normally no need to adjust for each sentence.  

* My Chinese translations are shared under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license ([see creative commons website for more information](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)). Bascially, that means you can use my work freely, without contact me first, *for non-commercial purposes*. Just make sure to *credit me* (mention my name), and, if you make any modifications, release your modifications under the identical license.  

* Chinese translations by other people are *not* included in my shares due to copyright reasons. Please refer to their individual sources for authorization and conditions of sharing.  

* I can share some lyrics libraries that may be of interest. Original Japanese lyrics and English translations can be found on [*STUDIO48*](http://stage48.net/studio48/lyricsindex.html). [*Team8的日常*](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv6000223) shares translations for Team 8 lyrics (サヨナラじゃない not included). [*麻里熊*](https://www.douban.com/doulist/1783038/) shares a complete library of all AKB48, sister groups, and even Nogizaka46's singles, albums, and theatre stages, *before the end of 2017*. [*夏本健*](https://weibo.com/u/5019394712) is constantly making high quality translations, *rhyming and suitable for singing*. Some of his old productions can also be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@AKBchinese/videos).  

Update log:  
23.04.29  - All 16 of Team 8's original songs  

### My personal workflow for video editting

I am kind of experienced in video editting. I started in 2017, using [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) because my university provided free license for students.  

However, after graduation, Adobe softwares were no longer available for free. Then I switched to open-sourced [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) in 2021, which I was not quite accustomed to actually. Therefore after I saw a recommendation of [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) from [Mediastorm](https://space.bilibili.com/946974), I immediately started with it. The free version of DaVinci Resolve already offers more than enough functions for me. So I believe I will continue using it for a long time.  

I edit subtitiles with [Aegisub](https://aegisite.vercel.app/), and export videos with hard-coded subtitles using [ArcTime Pro](https://arctime.org/).  

I use (at least from this year) open-sourced fonts [Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto) for my subtitiles.
