*This page is nolonger up-to-date and is subjected to a major revision in the near future.*  

This is an introduction of my [Whisper48 project](https://github.com/ifeimi/Whisper48).  

AI is changing our life! Take good notice of it : \)  

### About the project
In December 2022, OpenAI published their general-purpose speech recognition model [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), which was trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is able to perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.  
\
It turns out that this speech recognition model is super-helpful in the context of subtitiling. [Buzz](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/buzz) for example, an GUI integration of Whisper, has received 3.6k stars on GitHub for now.  
\
Subtitling, especially timestamping can be a tedious work, so that's where Whisper comes in. Powered by Whisper, Ayanaminn developed [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper) for subtitiling Nogizaka 46 videos. This project is deployed on Google Colab, thereby taking advantage of free GPU offered on the cloud.  
\
This project, [Whisper48](https://github.com/ifeimi/
Whisper48), is a fork from [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper) and sticked to the idea of running on Google Colab (simply because I don't have enough GPU!). Minor modifications were made to incorporate the usage of more accurate Whisper-based models ([WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) for example) and to adapt for other personal demands.  
\
In principle, usage of this kind of tools like [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper) or [Whisper48](https://github.com/ifeimi/Whisper48) should not be limited only to Nogizaka 48 or AKB48 videos. Thanks to the multilingual power of [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), videos in any common languages (French, German, Korean, ...) are supported. 

### Translation  

For my own experiences, different translation tools can be consulted: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator), [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/), and a very helpful web dictionary of my favorite - [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/).  

### Furthur editting and exporting

I edit subtitiles with [Aegisub](https://aegisite.vercel.app/), and export videos with hard-coded subtitles using [ArcTime Pro](https://arctime.org/).  

I use (at least from this year) open-sourced fonts [Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto) for my subtitiles.
